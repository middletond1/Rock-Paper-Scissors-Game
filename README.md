##### This game was very fun to build. While strengthening my ability to work with the DOM, I challenged myself to build code that was readable, succinct and clean while providing a fun, enjoyable UI. I also developed my ability to write functions that accepted multiple parameters, a concept I was not comfortable with before this. Building this app was an exciting challenge.
